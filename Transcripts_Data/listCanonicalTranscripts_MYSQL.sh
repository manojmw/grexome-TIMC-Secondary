# Build the list of canonical transcripts from Ensembl, by 
# connecting directly to the ensembl MYSQL database.
# Output to STDOUT a single column with ENST identifiers for 
# canonical transcripts.
#
# This is functionally equivalent to listCanonicalTranscripts_API.pl
# but the latter took 16h to run, this takes seconds...
# It can't be run at TIMC because it needs access to TCP/3306,
# which is filtered at TIMC. Just run it from eg nicofree.
