Expression Atlas has finally updated their Ensembl reference (to v104, current is v106).
Updating to latest GTEX:

mv E-MTAB-5214-query-results.tpms.tsv Old/

Then get latest from:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments-content/E-MTAB-5214/resources/ExperimentDownloadSupplier.RnaSeqBaseline/tpms.tsv

DONE.

I'ld like to update my GTEX data, or at least use mappings to a newer
Ensembl (I am currently using Ensembl v104).
However expression atlas / GXA is still stuck on Ensembl v99...
Nevermind not doing anything here...

Updating to latest GTEX file from Expression Atlas:
they haven't updated the actual GTEX dataset, but the gene names
and identifiers will be more up-to-date.
[The GXA webpage says they are using Ensembl 99, latest Ensembl is 101... 
GXA isn't current but it's better than the 04/2018 version I use now).

mv E-MTAB-5214-query-results.tpms.tsv Old/

Then get latest from:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments-content/E-MTAB-5214/resources/ExperimentDownloadSupplier.RnaSeqBaseline/tpms.tsv

DONE.

I'll use the expression atlas file, so easy: just change
$gtexFile.

I also changed $favoriteTissue to an array so we can have testis AND ovary.

DONE.

In 7_addGTEX/ I'm currently adding expression data from The Human Protein Atlas, 
"122 human individuals representing 32 different tissues".

Instead I actually want to add the GTEX latest release:
"450 donors and over 9600 RNA-seq samples across 51 tissue sites and 2 cell lines".

Data can be DL'd (after logging into google!) from:
https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets/
I DL'd "This file contains the median TPM by tissue":
GTEx_Analysis_2016-01-15_v7_RNASeQCv1.1.8_gene_median_tpm.gct.gz


Now I see this dataset is also available on Expression Atlas, nice because
it's the same format as I used previously. It's dataset E-MTAB-5214 , 
DL'd and renamed to E-MTAB-5214-query-results.tpms.tsv :
